## Peer Evaluation

+ [Group 3](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC-2022/Discussion/issues/62)


## Contributions of each group member

Aditi Nagaraj: Performed data cleaning, data manipulation/sanity checks, and made plots for RNA-seq
Credo Casmil: Did batch correction, differential gene expression analysis, and plotted goseq results
Ekpereka Amutaigwe: Did Gene Ontology analysis using goseq, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and developed a logistic regression model for predicting infection status
Dollina Dodani: Assisted with logistic regression, developed a KNN model and evaluated both models

**Note:** Apart from these individual contributions, we went over the steps together to ensure there were no mistakes.


##Do you think the tasks were fairly assigned and appropriate given each member’s background and skills? If not, how would you change it?

I think the tasks were fairly assigned. Members had the opportunity to learn new skills while also using already acquired skills. For example, I was already a bit comfortable with RNA-seq analysis before the start of the course but knew very little about machine learning. Therefore, I requested to be assigned tasks in machine learning to learn a thing or two about the topic.


##Explain your contributions to the project

**Initial and Final project proposals**

+ I handled the division of labour and made a table for it.
+ I developed the research questions, wrote the methodology for question 1, and contributed to the methodology for question 2. Dollina rephrased parts of the questions and wrote the methodology for questions 2 and 3.
+ I also proofread the final project proposal.

**Progress report**

+ I interpreted the box plot, density plot and heatmap in the progress report.
+ I performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and made a PCA plot and scree plot.

**Main project**
+ I was assigned Gene Ontology analysis and part of machine learning. Therefore, I carried out GO analysis using goseq, following guidelines from seminar 7. 
+ I also developed a logistic regression model using the link posted by Asfar Lathif as part of his feedback on our progress report.
+ I went through every code in the data cleaning and RNA-seq analysis steps and pointed out errors that we discussed and corrected.


**Presentation slides**

I added comments and Gene Ontology plots to the slides and made minor corrections to the conclusion.

##What worked well and what did not? What was the most challenging or rewarding moment during your group project?

+ Our ability to meet regularly via Zoom throughout the project made our schedule easy.
However, Slack messaging didn't work well as queries that needed immediate responses were sometimes delayed.
+ The most challenging part of our analysis was solving the issue of missing data. Apart from samples with all metadata missing, other incomplete samples data had only gender missing. So, we agreed to remove samples with all metadata missing and impute data for samples with only one metadata missing- gender. We spent sleepless nights looking for a solution until Aditi eventually succeeded. That was the most rewarding moment!

##How did you find having members of different backgrounds for a scientific project?

Having members with different backgrounds enabled us to work as a team to tackle challenges. It was helpful to have people studying bioinformatics in our group as they helped with the imputation problem. Dollina played a significant part in machine learning. She also helped me to understand a bit about machine learning.


##What have you learned from this group project?

+ I've learned a bit about data imputation
+ I had hands-on experience with machine learning. Apart from the seminars, I practiced PCA and plotting, making scree plots, k-means clustering (which was not used eventually), and logistic regression modelling.
+ I also practiced Gene Ontology analysis using goseq.
+ Interestingly, I learned to use Google to interpret error messages and look for solutions.
+ Finally, I learned teamwork!

##Any other comments on how the group project could have been structured differently (i.e. delivery requirements, assessment”)

In my opinion, the group project was well structured, especially holding us accountable at various steps such as initial and final proposals, specifying job assignments, the progress report that pushed us to start working on the project, the presentation that taught us presentation skills, technical report and individual report that compelled people to be fully involved in the project knowing that we would give accounts of our contributions towards the project.
